# Kntnt Fix Colon in Fragments of Relative URLs

WordPress mu-plugin that replaces colon with dash before saving content to database.

## Description

Colon is allowed in the fragment part of a URI according to RFC 3986 and is allowed in `id` and `name` in both HTML4 and HTML5. Despite these facts, WordPress removes everything up to and including the colon when a colon is used in a fragment of a relative or a protocol-relative URL. An example when this cause problem is when HTML generated by Markdown Extra is used, since colon is used in fragments to both link to the footnote (e.g. `#fn:1`) and link back (e.g. `#fnref:1`). Thus the need for this "hack" which replace colon with a dash in `id` and `name` attributes, and in `href` attributes that are relative (i.e. not starting with `http://`, `https://`. This is done before KSES runs and the post content is saved to the database.

## Installation

1. In your `wp-content` directory, create a `mu-plugin` directory if it not already exists.
2. Copy `kntnt-fix-colon-in-fragments-of-relative-urls.php` into `mu-plugin`. Only the file. Not this directory or the other files within it.
